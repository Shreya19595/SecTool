REYMON

This is tool to enable Security Analysts speed up the Reputation Checks!

Points to note for smooth working:

1. While selecting the input method, just input the number.

2. The Input file incase of multiple IP/URL/Domain/File Hash, the file type should be .csv (Comma separated value), NOT the one with UTF-8 signature.

3. The input data should always be copied in column A of the sheet one after the other, there is no restriction on maximum IP, url, etc.

4. The input file must be saved in same directory as the reymon application.

5. While inputting the filename use format “filename.csv”. Input in CLI is case sensitive.
